# Question

> Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

> k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

> You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

> **_Difficulty_** : _Hard_

## Thoughts before Coding

    Since linked list is a recursive tree structure, the brute force approach is using recursion with tranverse tree search. The easies way is to tranverse search algorithum with insertion in the beginning
